# This middle-man binary cleans output from the larger _matrix_menu binary and
# returns it to the user.
#
# NOTE: This is the binary that you SHOULD be using. Using '_matrix_menu' by itself
# returns some nasty hidden characters with your selection that will mess up
# any code trying to make use of the returned content.
