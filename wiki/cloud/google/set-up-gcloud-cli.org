=gcloud= is the Google Cloud CLI tool, similar to the =aws= command for AWS.

* Installation

To set up =gcloud= on a new computer, install the =gcloud= CLI tool
suite. Instructions for doing so will vary depending on your operating system or
Linux distribution.

* Configuration

To configure =gcloud=, run the following command:

#+begin_src sh
  gcloud init
#+end_src

The ensuing prompts will walk you through the setup process. The process is
simple: you will login to the appropriate Google account in your web browser,
then you will select which Google Cloud project with which you wish to interact.
