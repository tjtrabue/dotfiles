The Interactive Elixir shell (IEx) is a fantastic development tool that comes
with each Elixir distribution. This guide seeks to shed some light on its finer
features, as well as help with troubleshooting issues the reader may encounter
while using IEx.

* Cancelling a multiline command
If you find yourself in a bad situation while typing out a multiline command,
type =C-g=, the shortcut for "user switch command", followed by =i= (for
interrupt), then finally by =c= (to reconnect to the job). This should cancel
your command and drop you back into IEx shell session.
