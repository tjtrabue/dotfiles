* Graphical Issues
  First thing's first, make sure you are using the correct driver for your
  purposes. If you are running multiple monitors, you almost always want to use
  the proprietary NVIDIA driver.

** Screen Discoloration under NVIDIA proprietary driver
   If you experience screen discoloration when a screen updates, such as when
   scrolling a browser, make sure you have the following options set in your
   =/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf= file. Note that your board name will
   most likely be different than what is listed below:

#+begin_src sh
Section "Device"
  Identifier     "Device0"
  Driver         "nvidia"
  VendorName     "NVIDIA Corporation"
  BoardName      "GeForce GTX 1650 with Max-Q Design"
  Option         "TripleBuffer" "True"
  Option         "AllowIndirectGLXProtocol" "off"
EndSection
#+end_src
