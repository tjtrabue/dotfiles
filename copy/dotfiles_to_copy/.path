# This file contains entries that will be evaluated and concatenated together in
# order to construct the $PATH environment variable. Entries added to the end of
# the file take precedence over entries at the beginning of the file. Thus, if
# the executable `mybin` exists in both the "/bin" and the "/usr/bin"
# directories, and this file contains the entries:
#   /bin
#   /usr/bin
# in that order, then `mybin` in "/usr/bin" will be used when the user invokes
# `mybin` on the command line.
