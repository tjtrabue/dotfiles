Changes in 1.4.0
================

Sublime Text 3 build 3070 included a new API that allow us to show
tooltips with basic formated HTML on them.

This release implements this feature that should be available to anyone
using Sublime Text 3 build 3070 or newer.

### Notes
In build 3070 the tooltips doesn't play nice with the auto completion
the solution is to update to 3071 or better or just disable tooltips
in anaconda configuration file

Configuration Changes
=====================

* Display signatures is not true by default
* Tooltips are enabled by default
* More informative display signatures is enabled by default

Customizable Tooltips
=====================

The theme of the tooltips are customizable, there are two by default themes:

* Dark (for darker themes)
* Light (for lighter themes)

Users can create their own custom themes adding CSS files with their
customizations into `Packages/User/Anaconda.themes` like for example:

    Packages/User/Anaconda.themes/custom_tooltip.css

### CSS Template

```css
html {
    background-color: #141414;
    color: #d3bc5f;
}

h3 {
    color: #beb7c8;
    font-size: 1.2em;
}

.signature {
    margin-top: 4px;
}

.doc_signature {
    margin-top: 4px;
    color: #44849b;
    font-size: 1.2em;
}
```
