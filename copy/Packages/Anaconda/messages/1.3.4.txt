Changes in 1.3.4
================

- Vagrant Branch Updated
- Improved support for imports validation
- Fixd bug that was spotted in another project (https://github.com/randy3k/UnitTesting/pull/16/files#r18746892) that also affects anaconda

**notes**: If your imports depends of paths appended to the sys.path in tuntime
they are going to be mark as non valid for anaconda, because that, you can add
`# noqa` at the end of an import that is mark as invalid if you are sure that
anaconda is not handling well the import
