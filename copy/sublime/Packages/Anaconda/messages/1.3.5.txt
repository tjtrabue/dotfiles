Changes in 1.3.5
================

- Added regular expression to capture error output cmd in anaconda build system
- Added 'knob' gutter mark theme

Bug Fixes
=========

Fixed #231
    * When an environment hook file (.anaconda) was present but it
      could not being parsed as valid JSON, anaconda loops forever. Added
      gracefully fail and show an error message to inform the user about the
      problem in the hook file.

    * Fixed misspelled word environment in error message

    * Improved condition to show try to get the python_environment in
      the hook file depending on the view identification


Fixed #230
    * Seems like the PyLint linter had never worked at all due an
      unknown cache in PyLint when it's used as library (that is not
      supossed to). Taking a look in #230 I discovered that when
      `pylint.lint.Run(args)` is being used as library it caches the
      content of the given file or just the reporter output (I didn't
      determined really where the cahce was).
    * Change: Replaced the handler for a spawn process that call:
      sys.executebale -m pylint.lint args
