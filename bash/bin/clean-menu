# This middle-man binary cleans output from the larger menu binary and
# returns it to the user. This binary is my pride and joy, and I use it all
# the time when writing other programs.
#
# NOTE: This is the binary that you SHOULD be using. Using 'menu' by itself
# returns some nasty hidden characters with your selection that will mess up
# any code trying to make use of the returned content.
