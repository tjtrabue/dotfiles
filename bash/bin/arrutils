#!/usr/bin/env bash

# A binary for working with arrays in bash. This tool has option flags for a
# number of different operations to perform on arrays, providing a centralized
# area for manipulating them. Bash itself is pretty screwy when it comes to
# arrays, and does not provide many handy operations by default; hence, the
# need for a tool such as this.
# Treat this binary kind of like the Array class in Java.
#
# Usage:
#   arrutils []
#
# Options:
#   --remove-element <object>  : Removes the specified element from the array if
#                                it exists within the array.
#   --copy-array <arr1> <arr2> : Copies the elements of arr1 into a new array
#                                arr2.
#   --get-index-of <arr> <element> : Returns a set of integer indecies of a specified
#                                    element within arr. Returns -1 if the element is not present.
