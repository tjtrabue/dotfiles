" NOTE: fugitive commands do NOT work on external symlinks to files inside of a Git repo.
" This is because fugitive operates on individual files, not the current directory structure.
" If you want to be able to use fugitive commands, you must edit the file inside of the repo
" itself, not an external symlink to that file.
