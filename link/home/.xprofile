# This file is a shell script that the X server runs before the Window Manager
# starts, and thus acts as a place to configure services and start other one-
# time applications before you are dropped into a graphical session.
#
# You do not want to store such configuration in ~/.bashrc or other shell
# profile because they are tied to a particular shell environment
# (i.e., terminal) which is not only logically incohesive with starting global
# services, but could also cause duplicate service sessions to be created.
