;; Configuration file for the Slynk code server used by Emacs' SLY toolsuite

;; This file's syntax is that of Common Lisp's.

;; Needed to force SLY MREPL to flush strings to *query-io* every time a
;; (format *query-io* ...) form is used. Otherwise strings seem to be cached for
;; later outputting. Very frustrating.
;; Only tested with SBCL.
