" Configuration file for IdeaVim plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

" Emulated Plugins {{{
" These plugins are based on popular Vim plugins, and must be activated
" individually before they take effect. IdeaVim supports vim-plug syntax for
" activating plugins, which allows easy interoperability with an existing
" ~/.vimrc file.

" sethandler {{{

" IdeaVim allows defining handlers for the shortcuts that exist for both IDE

" list of handlers:
"   sethandler <key> <mode-list:handler> [<mode-list:handler> ...]
"
" The mode-list is a dash separated list of modes that is similar to guicursor
" notation and defines the following modes:
"
" n - normal mode
" i - insert mode
" x - visual mode
" v - visual and select modes
" a - all modes
"
" The handler is an argument that may accept the following values:
"
" ide - use IDE handler
" vim - use Vim handler
