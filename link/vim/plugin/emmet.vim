" NOTE: Default Emmet trigger sequence is Ctrl+y. You can remap this sequence with something
" like the following example (which remaps the sequence to Ctrl+z):
" let g:user_emmet_leader_key='<C-Z>'

" Enable all functions in all modes
let g:user_emmet_mode='a'

" Only enable normal mode functions
" let g:user_emmet_mode='n'
