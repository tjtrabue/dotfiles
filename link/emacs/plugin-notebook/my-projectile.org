Projectile is a project management plugin for Emacs that helps you perform
important coding actions at the project level. Such actions include searching
for project files, text searching (i.e., project-scoped =grep=), renaming files,
building and installing project artifacts, etc. Projectile is a project
management super tool, and by far one of the most important Emacs plugins for
software development.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package projectile
    ;; perspective.el overwrites projectile's command prefix, so we want to load
    ;; projectile after perspective.
    :after perspective
    :demand t
    :general
    ;; This extended general definition allows us to bind keymaps to keys
    ;; just like use-package's `bind-keymap' directive.
    (my/user-leader-def
      "p" '(:keymap projectile-command-map))
    (general-def 'normal 'override
      ;; Use C-p to search for files in project
      "C-p" 'projectile-find-file)
    :custom
    ;; Whether to cache files to improve performance. If you cache files,
    ;; Projectile may not find newly added project files until you restart Emacs.
    (projectile-enable-caching nil)
    ;; Figure out completion system to use automatically.
    (projectile-completion-system 'auto)
    ;; Lis of directory paths (and optional depths) that projectile should use
    ;; when searching for projects.
    (projectile-project-search-path `(,my/workspace-dir ,my/practice-dir))
    :init
    ;; Enable projectile globally.  It's important to keep this here!!! Do not
    ;; create an after-init-hook for projectile because it doesn't work
    ;; fully. You'll experience weird errors if you do this.
    (projectile-global-mode +1)
    :config
    ;; Add extra ignored directories here.
