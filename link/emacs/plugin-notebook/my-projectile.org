Projectile is a project management plugin for Emacs that helps you perform
important coding actions at the project level. Such actions include searching
for project files, text searching (i.e., project-scoped =grep=), renaming files,
building and installing project artifacts, etc. Projectile is a project
management super tool, and by far one of the most important Emacs plugins for
software development.

    ;; projectile after perspective.

    ;; This extended general definition allows us to bind keymaps to keys
    ;; just like use-package's `bind-keymap' directive.
