C# has long been Microsoft's pride and joy in the domain of application
programming, being exclusively available to Windows users. These days, however,
Microsoft's Common Language Runtime (CLR) has seen an open source release, so
now anybody can create CLR applications using Microsoft's languages. Hence, it
may be useful to configure Emacs for CLR programming, even if you're a
non-Windows programmer.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  ;; Currently unused due to bug in tree-sitter integration logic.
  ;; Uncomment this to see if the boys at the github repo pushed a fix.
  ;; (use-package csharp-mode
  ;;   :after (tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs)
  ;;   :config
  ;;   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.cs\\'" . csharp-tree-sitter-mode)))
#+end_src
