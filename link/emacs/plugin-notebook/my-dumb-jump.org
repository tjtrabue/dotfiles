=dumb-jump= is a jump-to-definition package that uses =grep=, =ag=, and =rg= to
figure out how to jump to the chosen definition. It require essentially no
configuration nor any TAGS files, making it a great out-of-the-box solution for
finding definitions at point. All you must do is add =dumb-jump= to the list of
=xref= backend functions, and you're off to the races!

After you've set up your =xref= hook, you can find the definition under the
cursor by typing =M-.=. Or, if you use =evil-mode=, by typing =gd= instead.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package dumb-jump
    :hook
    (xref-backend-functions . dumb-jump-xref-activate))
#+end_src
