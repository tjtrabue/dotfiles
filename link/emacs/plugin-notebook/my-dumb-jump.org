=dumb-jump= is a jump-to-definition package that uses =grep=, =ag=, and =rg= to
figure out how to jump to the chosen definition. It require essentially no
configuration nor any TAGS files, making it a great out-of-the-box solution for
finding definitions at point. All you must do is add =dumb-jump= to the list of
=xref= backend functions, and you're off to the races!

After you've set up your =xref= hook, you can find the definition under the
cursor by typing =M-.=. Or, if you use =evil-mode=, by typing =gd= instead.

* Dependencies
  =dumb-jump= requires these packages.

** xref
   This is bundled with Emacs 28.1 and newer, but sometimes we don't get access
   to the latest and greatest, so we can also download it from ELPA.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package xref
       ;; Can't get the right version with straight.el
       :disabled
       :demand t
       :custom
       (xref-show-definitions-function #'xref-show-definitions-completing-read))
   #+end_src

* use-package specification
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package dumb-jump
      :after xref
      :custom
      (dumb-jump-prefer-searcher 'rg)
      :init
      (setq xref-show-definitions-function
            #'xref-show-definitions-completing-read)
      (add-hook 'xref-backend-functions #'dumb-jump-xref-activate))
  #+end_src
