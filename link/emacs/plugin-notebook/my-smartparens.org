=smartparens= is a very popular Emacs plugin that automatically inserts closing
delimiters based on the syntax of the programming language currently in
use. However, =smartparens= can do much more than simply insert closing
delimiters. It can act as a whole editing environment for Lisp dialects similar
to ParEdit. You can think of it like =vim-surround= and =vim-endwise= put
together plus a bunch of language-aware features that neither of the
aforementioned Vim plugins have.

* Notes on =smartparens-mode= and =smartparens-strict-mode=
  This package contains two minor modes for managing delimiters:
  =smartparens-mode= and =smartparens-strict-mode=. =smartparens-mode= does not
  enforce balanced delimiters, whereas =smartparens-strict-mode= does.
