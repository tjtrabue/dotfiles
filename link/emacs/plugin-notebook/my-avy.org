=avy= is a similar plugin to =ace-jump-mode=, or =vim-easymotion=. It is newer
and more maintained than =ace-jump-mode=, however, making =avy= a better
alternative.

* =use-package= specification
   *NOTE:* See evil-leader config for other keybindings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package avy
    :after evil-collection
    :bind*
    (:map evil-normal-state-map
          ;; Jump to word beginning with character.
          ("f" . avy-goto-word-1)
          ;; Jump to text beginning with 1 input character.
          ("F" . avy-goto-char-2)
          ;; Jump to line based on an abbreviation.
          ("L" . avy-goto-line)))
