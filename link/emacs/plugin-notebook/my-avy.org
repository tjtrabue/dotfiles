=avy= is a jump-to-text plugin similar to =ace-jump-mode=, or =vim-easymotion=
for Vim/Neovim. It is newer and more feature-rich than =ace-jump-mode=, as well
as being actively maintained, making =avy= the better alternative.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package avy
    :after evil-collection
    :general
    (general-def '(normal motion)
      ;; Remap standard f/F t/T evil keybindings to avy motions.
      "f" 'evil-avy-goto-char
      "F" 'evil-avy-goto-word-1
      ;; Jump to line based on an abbreviation.
      "L" 'evil-avy-goto-line)
    :custom
    ;; How avy's overlay appears near matches.
    (avy-style 'at-full)
    ;; When non-nil, display line overlay next to the first non-whitespace
    ;; character.
