=avy= is a jump-to-text plugin similar to =ace-jump-mode=, or =vim-easymotion=
for Vim/Neovim. It is newer and more feature-rich than =ace-jump-mode=, as well
as being actively maintained, making =avy= the better alternative.

* =use-package= specification
   *NOTE:* See evil-leader config for other keybindings.

      ;; Jump to line based on an abbreviation.
