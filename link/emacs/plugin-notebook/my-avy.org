=avy= is a similar plugin to =ace-jump-mode=, or =vim-easymotion= for
Vim-derived editors. It is newer and more maintained than =ace-jump-mode=,
however, making =avy= a better, more modern alternative.

* use-package specification
   *NOTE:* See evil-leader config for other keybindings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package avy
    :after evil-collection
    :bind
    (:map evil-normal-state-map
          ("f" . avy-goto-char)
          ("F" . avy-goto-char-2)))
