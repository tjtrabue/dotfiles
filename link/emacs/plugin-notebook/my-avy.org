=avy= is a jump-to-text plugin similar to =ace-jump-mode=, or =vim-easymotion=
for Vim/Neovim. It is newer and more feature-rich than =ace-jump-mode=, as well
as being actively maintained, making =avy= the better alternative.

    ;; NOTE: See evil-leader config for other keybindings.
    (general-def '(normal motion)
