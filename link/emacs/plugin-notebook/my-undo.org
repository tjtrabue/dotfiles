This file adds some enhancements to Emacs' undo functionality.

* undo-tree
A visual tree system for fully utilizing Emacs' undo/redo system inspired by
Vim. To use =undo-tree=, call =M-x undo-tree-mode= (or
=global-undo-tree-mode=), and then use =C-x u= to call =undo-tree-visualize=,
the function that displays the tree of edits made to the current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'general)

  (use-package undo-tree
    ;; undo-tree can cause errors due to its history file feature. It's mostly
    ;; fine, but the errors can get annoying.
    :disabled
    :demand t
    :general
    (my/evil-leader-def
      "ut" 'undo-tree-visualize)
    :custom
    ;; Whether to show diffs when browsing through undo tree
    (undo-tree-visualizer-diff t)
    ;; Whether to save undo history to file
    (undo-tree-auto-save-history t)
    ;; Whether to show relative timestamps in undo tree
    (undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
    :config
    (global-undo-tree-mode 1))
#+end_src

* undo-fu
A simple plugin providing linear undo/redo actions. It does not interfere with
Emacs' internal undo data.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-fu
    :after evil-collection)
#+end_src

* undo-fu-session
Saves =undo-fu='s data across Emacs sessions so that Emacs remembers undo
history after restarting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-fu-session
    :demand t
    :custom
    ;; Whether to write linear undo history, omitting branches which were
    ;; themselves undone.
    (undo-fu-session-linear t)
    ;; Number of undo history files to store; nil to remove limit entirely.
    (undo-fu-session-file-limit 500)
    :config
    (global-undo-fu-session-mode 1))
#+end_src
