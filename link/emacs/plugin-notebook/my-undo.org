This file adds some enhancements to Emacs' undo functionality.

* undo-tree
  A visual tree system for fully utilizing Emacs' undo/redo system inspired by
  Vim. To use =undo-tree=, call =M-x undo-tree-mode= (or
  =global-undo-tree-mode=), and then use =C-x u= to call =undo-tree-visualize=,
  the function that displays the tree of edits made to the current buffer.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package undo-tree
      :demand t
      :config
      (global-undo-tree-mode 1))
  #+end_src

* undo-fu
  A simple plugin providing linear undo/redo actions. It does not interfere with
  Emacs' internal undo data.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package undo-fu
      :after evil-collection
      :general
      (general-def 'normal
        "u" 'undo-fu-only-undo))
  #+end_src

* undo-fu-session
  Saves =undo-fu='s data across Emacs sessions so that Emacs remembers undo
  history after restarting.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package undo-fu-session
      :demand t
      :config
      (global-undo-fu-session-mode 1))
  #+end_src
