=ctrlf= is an Emacs plugin for fast text searching within a buffer. It brands
itself as a replacement for =isearch=, but it is also trying to evolve into a
replacement for plugins like Swiper and Helm Swoop.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ctrlf
    :after evil-collection
    :demand t
    :preface
    (require 'general)
    :general
    (general-def
      ;; Remap standard Emacs isearch keybinding
      "C-s" 'ctrlf-forward-default)
    (general-def 'normal
      ;; Remap standard Emacs isearch keybinding
      "C-s" 'ctrlf-forward-default
      ;; Remap evil-search keys to ctrlf.
      ;; ctrlf integrates fully with evil-search history,
      ;; but you must set evil-search-module to 'evil-search
      "/" 'ctrlf-forward-default
      "?" 'ctrlf-backward-default)
    :custom
    ;; Use fuzzy search and regular expressions by default.
    (ctrlf-default-search-style 'fuzzy-regexp)
    :config
    ;; Enable ctrlf-mode globally
    (ctrlf-mode 1)
    ;; We want to use VI-style navigation for search results.
    (add-to-list 'ctrlf-minibuffer-bindings '("C-j" . ctrlf-forward-default))
    (add-to-list 'ctrlf-minibuffer-bindings '("C-k" . ctrlf-backward-default)))
