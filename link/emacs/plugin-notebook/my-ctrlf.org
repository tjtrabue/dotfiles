=ctrlf= is an Emacs plugin for fast text searching within a buffer. It brands
itself as a replacement for =isearch=, but it is also trying to evolve into a
replacement for plugins like Swiper and Helm Swoop. Currently, however it is not
as feature-rich as Swiper, and it does behave a little differently, so I
personally like to use CTRLF alongside Swiper.

* use-package specification
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ctrlf
      :after evil-collection
      :hook
      (after-init . ctrlf-mode)
      :bind
      (:map evil-normal-state-map
            ;; Remap standard Emacs isearch keybinding
            ("C-s" . ctrlf-forward-default))
      :custom
      ;; Use fuzzy search and regular expressions by default.
      (ctrlf-default-search-style 'fuzzy-regexp)
      :config
      ;; We want to use VI-style navigation for search results.
      (add-to-list 'ctrlf-minibuffer-bindings '("C-j" . ctrlf-forward-default))
      (add-to-list 'ctrlf-minibuffer-bindings '("C-k" . ctrlf-backward-default)))
