=vertico= provides a Helm-like completion UI for several completion frameworks,
including the built-in Emacs completion system and the =consult=
framework. Please keep in mind that =vertico= is only the UI. It is not a
completion framework unto itself.

* Vertico vs. other UIs
  Vertico is an alternative to completion frameworks such as Selectrum, Ivy,
  IDO, etc. The main difference is that Vertico aims to be as minimal as
  possible, only providing a pretty UI and deferring the completion system to
  other plugins, such as the built-in Emacs completion system or =orderless=.

* use-package specification
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package vertico
      ;; Disabled in favor of Selectrum, which is a bit more mature and
      ;; feature-packed, not to mention Selectrum integrates with `prescient.el',
      ;; and as far as I know Vertico does not.

      (:map vertico-map

            ([remap exit-minibuffer] . vertico-next)
            ("C-k" . vertico-previous)
            ;; Pressing ? brings up help for available completions
            ("?" . minibuffer-completion-help)
            ;; Complete selection with C-l
            ("C-l" . minibuffer-complete))
