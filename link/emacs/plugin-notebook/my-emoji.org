Here you will find plugins and configuration for displaying emojis in Emacs.

* emojify
  =emojify= is an Emacs extension to display emojis. It can display github style
  emojis like =:smile:= or plain ASCII ones like =:)=. It tries to be as
  efficient as possible, while also providing a lot of flexibility.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package emojify
      ;; Quite CPU-intensive for very little benefit.  I also find that I incidentially type an emoji
      ;; sequence when I did not intend to, and for tha reason I do not like using this plugin.
      :disabled
      :hook
      ;; Probably do not want to use emojify-mode in programming language files.
      ((magit-mode
        text-mode)
       . emojify-mode)
      :custom
      ;; Whether to automatically download required emojis.
      ;; Can be t, nil, or 'ask.
      (emojify-download-emojis-p t))
