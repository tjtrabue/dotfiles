Emacs configuration for log files.

* logview
Logview major mode for Emacs provides syntax highlighting, filtering and other
features for various log files. The main target are files similar to ones
generated by Log4j, Logback and other Java logging libraries, but there is
really nothing Java-specific in the mode and it should work just fine with any
log that follows similar structure, probably after some configuration.

The mode is meant to be operated in read-only buffer, so most of the command
bindings lack modifiers.

Out-of-the-box the mode should be able to parse standard SLF4J (Log4j, Logback)
files as long as they use ISO 8601 timestamps, Apache error logs, PHP Monolog
logs, and certain UNIX files in /var/log.
