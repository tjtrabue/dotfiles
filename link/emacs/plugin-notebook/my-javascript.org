Javascript is perhaps the mode widely used programming language in the world
today. I don't like it, but it is very important to be able to work with
Javascript in your favorite editor. This is my Emacs configuration for
Javascript integration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

* indium
  Indium is a fully featured Javascript development environment for Emacs.

** Installation Instructions
   Indium runs on a client-server architecture. Thus, you need to install the
   server before you can run Indium from Emacs.  You need to run =npm install -g
   indium= to install the Indium server.

** use-package specification
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     (use-package indium)
   #+end_src

* npm-mode
  Build and run NPM projects from Emacs.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (use-package npm-mode)
  #+end_src

  Major mode for editing JSX files.
