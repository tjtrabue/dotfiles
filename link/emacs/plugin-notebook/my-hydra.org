This file contains Plugins and configuration for the hydra hotkey macro package.

=hydra= is a system for defining a hotkey as a "gateway" to a group of
related hotkey commands. For instance, =C-*= could be mapped to the hydra
for zooming the current window in and out with the =j= and =k= keys. In fact,
such a hydra is defined within this file! To get rid of (or slay) the hydra,
all you have to do is hit any other key not defined within the current hydra.
After you do that, the hydra disappears, and the key that you just hit to
slay the hydra performs its normal function. Thus, if you were zooming in and
out with the =j= and =k= keys after hitting =C-*= and you hit =p= to slay the
hydra, then assuming you are using =evil-mode=, the hydra would disappear and
the contents of the selected paste register would be pasted at point.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

* Hydras
  This is where we define our hydras for use in various modes.

** hydra-zoom
   This is a simple, nearly trivial hydra used as an example and starting point
   for creating more complex specimens. All that =hydra-zoom= accomplishes is
   defining a zoom in/out hydra for the global keymap.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     (defun my/define-hydra-zoom ()
       "Wrapper function for defhydra hydra-zoom"

       (defhydra hydra-zoom (global-map "C-*")
         "Zoom in/out in the current window:"
         ("k" text-scale-increase "in")
         ("j" text-scale-decrease "out")))
   #+end_src

** hydra-resize-window
   This hydra resizes the current window using VI keys.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     (defun my/define-hydra-resize-window ()
       "Wrapper function for defhydra hydra-resize-window."
       (defhydra hydra-resize-window (evil-normal-state-map "C-]")
         "Resize window with VI keys"
         ("h" shrink-window-horizontally "shrink horizontally")
         ("j" enlarge-window "enlarge vertically")
         ("k" shrink-window "shrink vertically")
         ("l" enlarge-window-horizontally "enlarge horizontally")))
   #+end_src

* Activate hydras
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (defun my/define-hydras ()
      "Load custom hydra definitions."
      (interactive)
      (my/define-hydra-zoom)
      (my/define-hydra-resize-window))
  #+end_src

* use-package specification
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (use-package hydra
      :after evil-collection
      :hook
      (after-init . my/define-hydras))
  #+end_src
