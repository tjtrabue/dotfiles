Plugins and configuration for the Dart programming language.

* dart-mode
Major mode for editing Dart source code files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dart-mode
    ;; The repository appears to be deleted.
    :disabled)
#+end_src

* flutter
Flutter is a cross-platform mobile application development kit for the Dart
programming language.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package flutter
    ;; See note on dart-mode
    :disabled
    :after dart-mode
    :hook
    (dart-mode . flutter-test-mode)
    :general
    (general-def 'normal dart-mode-map
      ;; Run or reload Flutter
      "C-M-x" 'flutter-run-or-hot-reload)
    :custom
    ;; The directory containing your Flutter SDK
    (flutter-sdk-path (file-truename (concat (getenv "HOME") "/workspace/flutter"))))
#+end_src

* hover
=hover.el= allows you to run Flutter mobile apps on a desktop without the need
for an emulator.

Hover is an /alternative/ to =flutter.el=, which requires an emulator in order
to work. You probably do not want to use both plugins at the same time.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package hover
    ;; See note on dart-mode
    :disabled
    :after dart-mode
    :general
    (general-def dart-mode-map
      "C-M-z" 'hover-run-or-hot-reload
      "C-M-x" 'hover-run-or-hot-restart
      "C-M-p" 'hover-take-screenshot)
    (my/evil-leader-def dart-mode-map
      "hr" 'hover-run-or-hot-reload
      "hR" 'hover-run-or-hot-restart
      "hS" 'hover-take-screenshot))
#+end_src
