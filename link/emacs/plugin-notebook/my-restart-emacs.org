#+STARTUP: fold

Pretty straightforward. This package provides a function called =restart-emacs=
that does just that: it restarts Emacs. Quite handy, and worth binding to a key
in the global map.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'general)

  (use-package restart-emacs
    :demand t
    :general
    ;; Set the key sequence to something we're not bound to type accidentally.
    (my/evil-leader-def "rere" 'restart-emacs)
    :custom
    ;; Experimental feature: set this to t to restore frames when Emacs
    ;; restarts.
    ;; NOTE: persp-mode does a much better job of this task! Leave this
    ;; feature turned off.
    (restart-emacs-restore-frames nil))
#+end_src
