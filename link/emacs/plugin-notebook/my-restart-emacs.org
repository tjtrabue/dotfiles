#+STARTUP: fold

Pretty straightforward. This package provides a function called =restart-emacs=
that does just that: it restarts Emacs. Quite handy, and worth binding to a key
in the global map.

* use-package specification
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (use-package restart-emacs
      :after evil-leader
      :demand t
      :custom
      ;; Experimental feature: set this to t to restore frames when Emacs
      ;; restarts.
      ;; NOTE: persp-mode does a much better job of this task! Leave this
      ;; feature turned off.
      (restart-emacs-restore-frames nil)
      :config
      ;; Set the key sequence to something we're not bound to type accidentally.
      (evil-leader/set-key "rere" 'restart-emacs))
  #+end_src
