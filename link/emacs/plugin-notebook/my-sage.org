#+begin_quote
SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the
GPL. It builds on top of many existing open-source packages: NumPy, SciPy,
matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more.

The Sage authors wanted a free, open-source, viable alternative to Maple,
Mathematica, MatLab, and other proprietary computer algebra systems (CASs), and
Sage was their solution.

* Notes about Sage
Sage is a very heavyweight software system (about 3GB at the time of this
writing), and as such may not be viable on all platforms. Only install Sage if
you have a direct need to do so.

* sage-shell-mode
=sage-shell-mode= is an Elisp front-end for Sage.

It requires a local installation of Sage Math in order to function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sage-shell-mode
    :custom
    ;; Only enable this option for IPython version <7
    (sage-shell:use-prompt-toolkit nil)
    ;; Enable this option for IPython version >=7
    (sage-shell:use-simple-prompt t)
    ;; Disabling the following options can speed up Sage's startup.
    (sage-shell:set-ipython-version-on-startup nil)
    (sage-shell:check-ipython-version-on-startup nil)
    :init
    (add-hook 'sage-shell-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                ;; Use company completion in the Sage shell.
                (company-mode))))
