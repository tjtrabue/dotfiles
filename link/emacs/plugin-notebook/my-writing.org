Even programmers (or pro-grammars!) need to know how to write! These Emacs
plugins aid users in completing English language tasks.

* writegood-mode
This is a minor mode to aid in finding common writing problems. Matt Mightâ€™s
weaselwords scripts inspired this mode.

It highlights text based on a set of weasel-words, passive-voice and duplicate
words.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package writegood-mode
    :hook
    (text-mode . writegood-mode))
