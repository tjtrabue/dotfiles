#+STARTUP: fold

=expand-region= operates by incrementally expanding the currently selected
textual region to broader and broader scopes as you continue to press the
prescribed selection key.

*NOTE:* I defined a hydra for expand-region for convenience.  See =my-hydra.org=
for keybindings for my expand-region hydra.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package expand-region
    :after evil-collection
    :demand t
    :general
    (general-def 'visual
      ")" 'er/expand-region
      "(" 'er/contract-region))
#+end_src
