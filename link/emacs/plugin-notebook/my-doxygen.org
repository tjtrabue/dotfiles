#+STARTUP: fold

Doxygen is a fantastic, multi-lingual documentation engine based around using
special syntax embedded in comments in order to generate documentation. It is
similar to Java's =javadoc=, or Haskell's =haddock=.

* highlight-doxygen
  Adds advanced syntax highlighting to Doxygen comments.

  *NOTE*: Do *NOT* activate this minor mode in =org-mode=!!! Doing so will slow
  Emacs to an absolute crawl. This problem was incredibly hard to debug. Please,
  for the love of efficient text editing, do not repeat my mistake.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package highlight-doxygen
    :hook
    ;; Only highlight doxygen comments in appropriate languages
    ((c-mode-common java-mode perl-mode php-mode python-mode)
       . highlight-doxygen-mode))
