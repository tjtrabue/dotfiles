=ripgrep= or =rg= is an incredibly fast searching tool for UNIX-based operating
systems.  It behaves similarly to =grep= and =ag=, but is faster than either of
them. I highly recommend that you use =rg= over =grep= or even =ag= whenever
possible.

* rg
  =rg= is the primary =ripgrep= package for Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package rg
    :after (helm)
    :config
    (rg-enable-default-bindings))
#+end_src

* ripgrep
  Another =ripgrep= integration package. Can be handy if the standard =rg=
  package is not working properly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package ripgrep)
#+end_src
