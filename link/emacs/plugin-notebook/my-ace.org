Configuration for the fantastic ace modes, such as =ace-jump-mode= used to
quickly move around a buffer, or ace-window used as a replacement for =C-o=.

*NOTE:* =ace-jump-mode= is old and no longer maintained, so I recommend using
=avy= as a modern alternative. See =my-avy= for configuration details.

* Ace Window
Quick and easy window navigation, Ace style! This plugin extends the buffer
jumping system of =ace-jump-mode= to navigating between windows, as well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ace-window
    :general
    (general-def 'override
      ;; Remap C-o to the ace-window function
      [remap other-window] 'ace-window
      ;; `C-x 0' should invoke ace-delete-window
      [remap delete-window] 'ace-delete-window
      ;; `C-x 1' should invoke ace-delete-other-windows
      [remap delete-other-windows] 'ace-delete-other-windows
      ;; Also use C-, to call ace-window
      "C-," 'ace-window)
    :custom
    ;; Set window selection keys to the home row ones.
    (aw-keys '(?a ?s ?d ?f ?g ?h ?j ?k ?l)))
#+end_src

* Ace Link
Quickly follow links in =help-mode=, =info-mode=, =woman-mode=, =eww-mode=,
=compilation-mode=, and =custom-map-mode=.  Uses the =o= key by default to
select a link.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ace-link
    :demand t
    :general
    ;; `C-c o' follows links in in `org-mode'
    (my/user-leader-def org-mode-map
      "o" 'ace-link-org)
    :config
    (ace-link-setup-default))
