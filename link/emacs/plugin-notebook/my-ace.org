Configuration for the fantastic ace modes, such as =ace-jump-mode= used to
quickly move around a buffer, or ace-window used as a replacement for =C-o=.

*NOTE:* Most keybindings are set in my-evil.el since that is where evil-mode's
        map leader key bindings must be set. Also, =ace-jump-mode= is old and no
        longer maintained, so I recommend using =avy= as a modern
        alternative. See =my-avy= for configuration details.

* Ace Window
  Quick and easy window navigation, Ace style! This plugin extends the buffer
  jumping system of =ace-jump-mode= to navigating between windows, as well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ace-window
    :after evil-collection
    :general
    (general-def 'override
      ;; Remap C-o to the ace-window function
      [remap other-window] 'ace-window
      ;; Also use C-, to call ace-window
      "C-," 'ace-window)
    :custom
    ;; Set window selection keys to the home row ones.
    (aw-keys '(?a ?s ?d ?f ?g ?h ?j ?k ?l)))

* Ace Link
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Quickly follow links in org-mode, help-mode, info-mode, etc.
  ;; Uses the 'o' key by default to select a link.
  (use-package ace-link
    :config
    (ace-link-setup-default))
#+end_src
