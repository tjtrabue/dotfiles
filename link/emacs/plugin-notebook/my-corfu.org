=corfu= is a minimal completion overlay that uses Emacs' built-in =capf=
capabilities to provide completion candidates. This is in contrast to =company=,
which uses customized backends which deviate from Emacs' standard completion
system. You can think of =corfu= as a completion in region counterpart to
=vertico=, which provides a narrowing completion buffer for Emacs'
=completing-read= API.
