Emacs has some pretty sweet built-in calculator features, as well as some even
sweeter plugins.

* literate-calc-mode
Displays inline results for calculations, supports variables and updates as you
type (if you want). Also works in your favourite markup mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package literate-calc-mode
    :hook
    ((markdown-mode
      org-mode)
     . literate-calc-minor-mode))
#+end_src
