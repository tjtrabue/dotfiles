Combobulate is a package that adds structured editing and movement to a wide
range of programming languages. Unlike most programming major modes that use
error-prone imperative code and regular expressions to determine what's what in
your code, Combobulate uses Emacs 29's =tree-sitter= library. Tree-sitter
maintains a concrete syntax tree of your code, providing Combobulate absolute
clarity of all aspects of your code, enabling more correct movement and editing
than you would otherwise have.
