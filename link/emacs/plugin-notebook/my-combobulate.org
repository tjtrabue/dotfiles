#+STARTUP: fold

=combobulate= is a package that adds structured editing and movement to a wide
range of programming languages. Unlike most programming major modes that use
error-prone imperative code and regular expressions to determine what's what in
your code, Combobulate uses Emacs 29's =tree-sitter= library. Tree-sitter
maintains a /concrete syntax tree/ of your code, providing =combobulate=
absolute clarity of all aspects of your code, enabling more correct movement and
editing than you would otherwise have.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package combobulate
    ;; Only use combobulate if we have a tree-sitter enabled Emacs.
    :if (string-match-p "\sTREE_SITTER\s" system-configuration-features))
