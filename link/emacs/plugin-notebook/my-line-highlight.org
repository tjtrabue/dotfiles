#+STARTUP: fold

=beacon=, =pulsar=, and possibly other packages provide a feature that
temporarily highlights the current line when the cursor jumps within a buffer or
across buffers.

* Beacon
Pulse a colorful highlight on the current line when the cursor jumps.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package beacon
    ;; Beacon can be pretty expensive in terms of CPU cycles.
    :disabled
    :demand t
    :config
    ;; Enable beacon globally.
    (beacon-mode 1))
#+end_src

* Pulsar
Pulsar is minimalist alternative to Beacon. Beacon tends to be computationally
intensive, which makes it non-viable for large files. Pulsar behaves much nicer
with files of any size.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pulsar
    :hook
    (after-init . pulsar-global-mode)
    :custom
    (pulsar-pulse-functions
     '(recenter-top-bottom
       move-to-window-line-top-bottom
       reposition-window
       forward-page
       backward-page
       scroll-up-command
       scroll-down-command
       org-next-visible-heading

       outline-backward-same-level
       outline-forward-same-level
       outline-next-visible-heading
       outline-previous-visible-heading
       outline-up-heading))
