=beacon=, =pulsar=, and possibly other packages provide a feature that
temporarily highlights the current line when the cursor jumps within a buffer or
across buffers.

* Beacon
Pulse a colorful highlight on the current line when the cursor jumps.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package beacon
    ;; Beacon can be pretty expensive in terms of CPU cycles.
    :disabled
    :demand t
    :config
    ;; Enable beacon globally.
    (beacon-mode 1))
#+end_src

* Pulsar
Pulsar is minimalist alternative to Beacon. Beacon tends to be computationally
intensive, which makes it non-viable for large files. Pulsar behaves much nicer
with files of any size.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pulsar
    ;; Disabled because I don't find Pulsar that useful, and disabling it saves precious CPU cycles.
    :disabled
    :demand t
    :custom
    (pulsar-pulse t)
    (pulsar-delay 0.055)
    (pulsar-iterations 10)
    (pulsar-face 'pulsar-magenta)
    (pulsar-highlight-face 'pulsar-yellow)
    :config
    (pulsar-global-mode 1))
#+end_src
