#+STARTUP: fold

Really beautiful file explorer for Emacs. Treemacs opens in a sidebar window and
appears much like any other project file tree explorer, but provides many, many
features absent from the majority of such explorers.

* treemacs
  This is the configuration for =treemacs= itself.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package treemacs
      :after all-the-icons
      :commands treemacs
      :general
      (general-def
        "M-0" 'treemacs-select-window)
      (my/user-leader-def
        "t 1" 'treemacs-delete-other-windows
        "t t" 'treemacs
        "t B" 'treemacs-bookmark
        "t P" 'treemacs-add-and-display-current-project
        "t C-t" 'treemacs-find-file
        "t M-t" 'treemacs-find-tag)
      (my/evil-leader-def
        "tm" 'treemacs
        "tP" 'treemacs-add-and-display-current-project)
      :init
      (with-eval-after-load 'winum
        (define-key winum-keymap (kbd "M-0") #'treemacs-select-window))
      :custom
      ;; Whether to put an empty line between root nodes.
      (treemacs-space-between-root-nodes nil)
      :config
      (treemacs-follow-mode t)
      (treemacs-filewatch-mode t)
      (treemacs-fringe-indicator-mode t)
      (pcase (cons (not (null (executable-find "git")))
                   (not (null treemacs-python-executable)))
        (`(t . t)
         (treemacs-git-mode 'deferred))
        (`(t . _)
         (treemacs-git-mode 'simple))))
  #+end_src

* Plugins
** treemacs-projectile
   Integration with =projectile= project manager.
   Currently I have had to add an advising function to =projectile= in order to
   update the =treemacs= workspace when we switch =projectile= projects because
   =treemacs-projectile= does not take care of this on its own.

*** Helper Functions
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun my/sync-treemacs-with-projectile ()
        "Add advising functions to keep treemacs in sync with projectile
      whenever a new projectile project is visited. I don't know why
      treemacs-projectile does not provide this feature itself."
        (advice-add 'projectile-switch-project-by-name
                    :after (lambda (&rest args)
                             (let* ((path (car args))
                                    (name (treemacs--filename path)))
                               (treemacs-do-add-project-to-workspace path name)))))
    #+end_src

*** =use-package= specification
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package treemacs-projectile
        :after (treemacs projectile)
        :commands treemacs-projectile
        :general
        ;; Automatically prefixed with "C-c"
        (my/user-leader-def
          "t p" 'treemacs-projectile)
        ;; evil-leader shortcuts
        (my/evil-leader-def
          "tp" 'treemacs-projectile)
        :config
        ;; Make sure to add new projects to treemacs workspace when we switch
        ;; to a new projectile project.
        ;; For some reason treemacs-projectile does not do this by itself.
        (my/sync-treemacs-with-projectile))
    #+end_src

** treemacs-perspective
   Scopes =treemacs= to =perspective.el=.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package treemacs-perspective
       :after (treemacs perspective)
       :demand t)
   #+end_src
