From the Emacs manual:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Bookmarks are somewhat like registers in that they record positions you can
  jump to. Unlike registers, they have long names, and they persist
  automatically from one Emacs session to the next. The prototypical use of
  bookmarks is to record where you were reading in various files.
#+END_QUOTE

* bookmark-plus
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package bookmark-plus)
#+end_src
