=orderless= provides an orderless completion style that divides the pattern into
space-separated components, and matches candidates that match all of the
components in any order. Each component can match in any one of several ways:
literally, as a regexp, as an initialism, in the flex style, or as multiple word
prefixes. By default, regexp and literal matches are enabled.
