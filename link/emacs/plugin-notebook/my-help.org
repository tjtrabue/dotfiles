Plugins and configuration for Emacs' help features.  See the HelpPlus page on
the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HelpPlus ][EmacsWiki]] for more information.

* helpful
=helpful= is an alternative to Emacs' built-in help system that provides far
more contextual information. It is essentially a drop-in replacement for the
help system.

    :disabled

    (helpful :type git :host github :repo "Wilfred/helpful"
             ;; We need to disable native-compilation for helpful because
             ;; `helpful.el' contains a compile-time error. May want to
             ;; re-investigate this issue at a later date, but for now this
             ;; appears to fix the problem.
             :build (:not native-compile))
    :general
    (general-def
      ;; Replace standard help functions with helpful functions.
