Plugins and configuration for Emacs' help features.  See the HelpPlus page on
the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HelpPlus ][EmacsWiki]] for more information.

* helpful
=helpful= is an alternative to Emacs' built-in help system that provides far
more contextual information. It is essentially a drop-in replacement for the
help system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package helpful
    ;; 2/17/2022
    ;; helpful has not yet implemented new Emacs' (version 29.0.50 and
    ;; onward) symbol reading capabilities, so it will not work with those
    ;; versions of Emacs. The error encountered is "void variable
    ;; read-symbol-position-list". Keep checking for updates to see if the
    ;; maintainers implemented a fix for this issue.
    :if (< emacs-major-version 29)
    :general
    (general-def
      ;; Replace standard help functions with helpful functions.
      "C-h f" 'helpful-callable
      "C-h v" 'helpful-variable
      "C-h k" 'helpful-key
      ;; Other useful keybindings.
      "C-h C" 'helpful-command
      "C-h F" 'helpful-function)
    (my/user-leader-def
      "C-d" 'helpful-at-point))
