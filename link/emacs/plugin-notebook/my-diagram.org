Here you will find various plugins for generating and interacting with diagrams,
such as UML, sequence diagrams, class relationship diagrams, etc.

* mermaid-mode
  Major mode for editing buffers written in Mermaid syntax for generating
  diagram images. Requires the =mmdc= CLI executable to be installed, which is a
  Node.js tool. Check the installation instructions for =mermaid-cli=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package mermaid-mode
      :mode
      ;; Associate the .mmd and .mermaid extensions with mermaid-mode.
      ("\\.mmd$" "\\.mermaid$")
      :custom
      ;; Where to find the mmdc, the mermaid command line tool.
      ;; You must have mmdc installed in order for mermaid-mode to work.
      (mermaid-mmdc-location (executable-find "mmdc"))
      ;; Should be ".png", ".pdf", or ".svg"
      (mermaid-output-format ".png")
      ;; Extra CLI flags to pass to mmdc.
      (mermaid-flags (concat "-t dark -b "
                             (face-attribute 'default :background))))
