Ligatures are special composite characters rendered in order to represent two or
more standard Unicode characters in a more aesthetically pleasing and readily
identifiable way. Emacs does not have native support for typographic ligatures,
but there are plugins available that provide such features.

*NOTE:* You must use a compatible font in order for ligatures to render
properly. If you encounter errors with these plugins, please ensure that Emacs
is using an appropriate font.

* ligature
Allows the user to specify which ligatures they want to use per major mode. Note
that each set of ligatures must be compatible with the selected font, and each
set of ligatures may not be compatible with others.
