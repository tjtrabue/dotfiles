=origami= is a smart code-folding plugin for Emacs.

As a rule, Emacs supports lots of different code-folding minor modes, some
of which are built-in, some are external plugins. =origami= is of the latter
category, and it is one of the best representatives.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package origami
    :hook
    (prog-mode . origami-mode))
#+end_src
