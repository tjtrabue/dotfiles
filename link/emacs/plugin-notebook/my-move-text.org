This file contains plugins and configuration for moving words, lines, or regions
around in Emacs buffers.

* Drag Stuff
  This is an alternative to =move-text= with more features, such as the ability
  to drag words back and forth. It integrates with =evil-mode='s visual
  selection much better than =move-text=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package drag-stuff
      :demand t
      :delight
      :general
      (general-def '(normal visual) drag-stuff-mode-map
        "M-k" 'drag-stuff-up
        "M-j" 'drag-stuff-down
        ;; "M-h" 'drag-stuff-left
        ;; "M-l" 'drag-stuff-right
        )
      ;; NOTE: Can't use `:custom' stanza to customize drag-stuff
      ;;       variables because the author used `defvar' instead
      ;;       of `defcustom' to define the plugin's variables.
      :init
      ;; Do not activate drag-stuff for lisp files since we want
      ;; to use lispy commands to drag s-exps.
      (setq drag-stuff-except-modes my/lisp-major-modes)
      :config
      (drag-stuff-global-mode 1))
  #+end_src

* move-text
  Easily move lines of text up and down with the =move-text= package. I have
  found that this plugin does not work well with =evil-mode='s visual line
  selection, so if you use =evil-mode=, I'd opt for Drag Stuff, instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package move-text
    ;; Currently using Drag Stuff instead.
    :disabled
    :general
    (general-def 'normal 'override
      "M-j" 'move-text-down
      "M-k" 'move-text-up)
    (general-def 'visual 'override
      "M-j" 'move-text-region-down
      "M-k" 'move-text-region-up))
#+end_src
