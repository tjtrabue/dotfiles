Powerline is perhaps the most popular statusline theme for UNIX programs.  It
started as a plugin for customizing Vim's modeline, and due to its popularity it
has grown into a staple of nearly every persistent UNIX application, terminal or
GUI oriented.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package powerline
    ;; Currently using Doom Emacs' modeline.
    :disabled
    :init
    ;; Set the shape of the segment separator
    (setq powerline-default-separator 'wave)
    :config
    ;; The powerline theme to use
    (powerline-center-evil-theme))
