Powerline is perhaps the most popular statusline theme for UNIX programs.
It started as a plugin for customizing Vim's modeline, and due to its popularity
it has grown into a staple of nearly every persistent UNIX application, terminal
or GUI oriented.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package powerline
  :init
  (setq powerline-default-separator 'contour)
  :config (powerline-default-theme))
#+end_src
