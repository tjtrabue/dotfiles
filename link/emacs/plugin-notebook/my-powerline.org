Powerline is perhaps the most popular statusline theme for UNIX programs.
It started as a plugin for customizing Vim's modeline, and due to its popularity
it has grown into a staple of nearly every persistent UNIX application, terminal
or GUI oriented.

I prefer the =spaceline= modeline to =powerline= since it's fancier and more
extensible.

Note that you do not need to manually installing this plugin in order to
installing =spaceline=, I have left my configuration because =spaceline= does
inherit some of =powerline='s properties.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package powerline
    :init
    (setq powerline-default-separator 'contour)
    ;; :config
    ;; (powerline-default-theme)
  )
#+end_src
