=ripgrep= or =rg= is an incredibly fast searching tool for UNIX-based operating
systems.  It behaves similarly to =grep= and =ag=, but is faster than either of
them. I highly recommend that you use =rg= over =grep= or even =ag= whenever
possible.

* deadgrep
  =deadgrep= is a beautiful front-end for =ripgrep=, the faster replacement for
  =grep= and =ag=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package deadgrep
    ;; Make sure the system package manager has installed ripgrep before loading
    ;; this plugin.
    :ensure-system-package
    ;; This cdr maps a binary name to its corresponding system package name.
    (rg . ripgrep)
    :bind
    (("C-c S" . deadgrep)))
#+end_src
