=ripgrep= or =rg= is an incredibly fast searching tool for UNIX-based operating
systems.  It behaves similarly to =grep= and =ag=, but is faster than either of
them. I highly recommend that you use =rg= over =grep= or even =ag= whenever
possible.

* deadgrep
  =deadgrep= is a beautiful front-end for =ripgrep=, the faster replacement for
  =grep= and =ag=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package deadgrep
      :commands deadgrep
      :general
      (my/user-leader-def
        "S" 'deadgrep))
  #+end_src

* ripgrep
  Another =ripgrep= package for Emacs needed by some other plugins.
  *NOTE:* Please keep this package around for the sake of =projectile=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ripgrep)
  #+end_src
