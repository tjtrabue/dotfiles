=escreen= is essentially an Emacs version of GNU Screen (which has been
superseded by =tmux=).

* escreen
  Window manager for Emacs windows. This should not be confused with a graphical
  window manager for an entire computing environment, such as =i3= (even though
  Emacs is capable of acting as such). =escreen= simply manages Emacs' editing
  windows.

  I recommend you use =helm-escreen= for all interactions with =escreen= to make
  your life easier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package escreen
    :init
    ;; Have to set this value here since some internal function is trying
    ;; to reference the `escreen-current-screen-number' function as a
    ;; variable.
    (setq-default escreen-current-screen-number 0)
    :config
    (escreen-install))
#+end_src
