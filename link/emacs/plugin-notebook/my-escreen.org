=escreen= is essentially an Emacs version of GNU Screen (which has been
superseded by =tmux=).

=escreen= is a window manager for Emacs windows. This should not be confused
with a graphical window manager for an entire computing environment, such as
=i3= (even though Emacs is capable of acting as such). =escreen= simply manages
Emacs' editing windows.

I recommend you use =helm-escreen= for all interactions with =escreen= to make
your life easier.

* Deprecated in favor of perspective.el
  =escreen= is largely unmaintained. =perspective.el= provides a better, more
  modern solution for managing buffers and windows in Emacs.

* =use-package= specification
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package escreen
    ;; perspective.el is a better alternative
    :disabled
    :init
    ;; Have to set this value here since some internal function is trying
    ;; to reference the `escreen-current-screen-number' function as a
    ;; variable.
    (setq-default escreen-current-screen-number 0)
    :config
    (escreen-install))
