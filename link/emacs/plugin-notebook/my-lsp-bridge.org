=lsp-bridge= is a super fast LSP client for Emacs that leverages Python's
threading technology to build caches that bridge Emacs and the LSP server. The
goal is to provide a smooth completion experience without compromising Emacs'
performance.

At the time of this writing, =lsp-bridge= is still in its infancy, and
=lsp-mode= offers a better overall experience. I'd keep my eye on the project,
though, and consider switching to =lsp-bridge= once they work out the kinks.
