* system-packages
  Manage your operating system packages from inside Emacs. =system-packages=
  know about a lot of package managers by default, but you can always register
  more.

  *NOTE:* =system-packages= uses TRAMP to connect to your package manager, which
  can be incredibly slow if you have not set your PS1 environment variable to
  something simple (like =tramp $=). See my =.bashrc= file for an example of how
  to set your prompt for TRAMP integration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package system-packages
    :init
    ;; Enable sudo for system-packages
    (setq system-packages-use-sudo t))
#+end_src
