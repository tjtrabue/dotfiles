Docker is, quite possibly, the single greatest software deployment innovation of
the past 30 years. Instead of manually configuring applications to run on a
particular machine, with all of the implied shared libraries and runtimes
necessary for the application's to run, Docker abstracts the runtime
environment, running the application in a /container/ which includes all
required OS libraries, runtime environments, environment variables, and files.

* docker
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'general)

  (use-package docker
    :general
    (my/user-leader-def
      "d" 'docker))
#+end_src

* dockerfile-mode
Major mode for interacting with Dockerfiles.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dockerfile-mode
    :mode "Dockerfile\\'")
#+end_src
