Sometimes, one must do...things. Terrible things. Unforgivable things. Things
that break Emacs' model of garbage collection in service of slightly enhancing
the user's typing experience. This files contains my baroque and iniquitous
configuration for tweaking Emacs' GC behavior.

* GCMH
GCMH is the "garbage collector magic hack" for Emacs. It enforces a sneaky GC
strategy to minimize interference with user activity. The strategy works like
this: During normal use, =gcmh= sets a GC cons threshold. When idling, =gcmh=
triggers the GC and a low threshold is set.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package gcmh
    ;; Seems to reduce Emacs' performance.
    :disabled
    :demand t
    :delight
    :config
    (gcmh-mode 1))
#+end_src
