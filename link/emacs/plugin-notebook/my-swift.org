Swift is Apple's flagship programming language, and the spiritual successor to
Objective C. It borrows many of the benefits of Objective C while overcoming
many of its problems, such as weak typing and dangerous memory manipulation.

* swift-mode
Major mode for editing Swift source code files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package swift-mode)
#+end_src

* swift-playground-mode
Minor mode providing the incredible Swift Playground feature for
Emacs. Playgrounds are one of the killer features of XCode, so having them in
Emacs greatly bridges the divide between the two editors.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package swift-playground-mode
    :hook
    (swift-mode . swift-playground-global-mode))
#+end_src
