This file contains plugin specifications for integrating various PDF tools with
Emacs.

* pdf-tools
  An extremely powerful suite of tools for working with PDFs in Linux. The catch
  is the "in Linux" part of that last sentence: as of now, only Linux
  distributions are covered by this plugin.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package pdf-tools
      ;; Only Linux is currently supported
      :if (memq system-type '(gnu gnu/linux)))
  #+end_src

* pdf-view-restore
  An add-on to =pdf-tools= that allows users to open PDFs at their last known
  position.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package pdf-view-restore
      :after pdf-tools
      :hook
      (pdf-view-mode . pdf-view-restore-mode))
  #+end_src
