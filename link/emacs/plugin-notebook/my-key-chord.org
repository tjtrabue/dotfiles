It is difficult in Emacs to map a series of keystrokes to a particular function,
which is a common task in Vim. Emacs tends to favor mapping a large combination
of keys hit in unison, also known as key chords. The =key-chord= library
provides functionality for achieving Vim-like key mappings within Emacs.

* Variable definitions
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defvar my/key-chord-config-file
      (concat (file-name-sans-extension
               (or load-file-name buffer-file-name)) ".org")
      "The full path to the file containing my key-chord configuration.")
  #+end_src

* Function definitions

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun rechord ()
      "Re-load the my-key-chord config file to fix issues."
      (interactive)
      (org-babel-load-file my/key-chord-config-file))
  #+end_src

* key-chord
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package key-chord
      :init
      ;; Start key-chord-mode globally
      (key-chord-mode 1))
  #+end_src
