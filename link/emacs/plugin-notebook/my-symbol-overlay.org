Symbol Overlay allows Emacs users to highlight symbols in any major mode and
then operate on those symbols, such as go to definition, rename, etc. It was
inspired by the =highlight-symbol= package, but =symbol-overlay= is much faster
and more powerful.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package symbol-overlay
    :preface
    (require 'general)
    :general
    (my/user-leader-def
      ;; This extended general definition allows binding keymaps to keys similar
      ;; to use-package's `bind-keymap' directive.
      "O" '(:keymap symbol-overlay-map))
    (general-def symbol-overlay-map
      "R" 'symbol-overlay-remove-all)
    (general-def '(normal visual)
      ;; This is a good default renaming function.  LSP clients are typically better at refactoring,
      ;; though, so you should remap this keybinding when you have an LSP client active.
      "gr" 'symbol-overlay-rename))
