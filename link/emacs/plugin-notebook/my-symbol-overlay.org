Symbol Overlay allows Emacs users to highlight symbols in any major mode and
then operate on those symbols, such as go to definition, rename, etc. It was
inspired by the =highlight-symbol= package, but =symbol-overlay= is much faster
and more powerful.

* =use-package= specification
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package symbol-overlay
    :general
    (my/user-leader-def
      ;; This extended general definition allows binding keymaps to keys similar
      ;; to use-package's `bind-keymap' directive.
      "O" '(:keymap symbol-overlay-map))
    (general-def symbol-overlay-map
      "R" 'symbol-overlay-remove-all))
#+end_src
