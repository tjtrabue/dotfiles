Org is one of Emacs' killer apps: a powerful ORGanizer and much more, Org
enables Emacs users to engage in literate programming, a method of software
development where source code is embedded into explanatory, notebook-like
textual documents and evaluated as needed, or all at once.

* =use-package= specification
  The ubiquitous =org-mode=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package org
      :mode ("\\.org\\'" . org-mode)
      :bind
      ;; These bindings should be available everywhere.  We'll want to use them
      ;; outside of org-mode.
      (("C-c o l" . org-store-link)
       ("C-c o a" . org-agenda))
      :custom
      (org-hide-leading-stars 1)
      ;; Only show headings when visiting a new Org file.
      (org-startup-folded 'fold)
      ;; Directory used by Org only in rare circumstances, such as when filing
      ;; away remember notes.
      (org-directory my/org-dir)
      ;; Pressing return while point is over a hyperlink will open the link in
      ;; the user's web browser.
      (org-return-follows-link t)
      ;; Record a timestamp when a TODO item is marked as done.
      (org-log-done 'time)
      ;; Set Org agenda files to a list of files and/or directories.
      (org-agenda-files `(,my/org-agenda-dir))
      :init
      ;; Make sure the Org notes directory is present.
      (make-directory my/org-dir t)
      ;; Also create the agenda directory.
      (make-directory my/org-agenda-dir t))
  #+end_src

* Plugins
** org-bullets
   Use fancy bullets in =org-mode=.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package org-bullets
       :after org
       :hook
       (org-mode . (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1))))
   #+end_src

** org-beautify-theme
   Remove colors from headings, and instead differentiate them by changing
   their font size.

   *NOTE:* This theme *MUST* be loaded *AFTER* your primary Emacs theme!
   Otherwise all of your =.org= files will look awful, with each heading
   surrounded by big ugly boxes. See file =my-theme.org= for this theme's
   activation.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package org-beautify-theme
       :after org
       :demand t)
   #+end_src

** org-roam
   =org-roam= is an amazing plugin that integrates some of Roam's advanced note
   taking features into =org-mode=. =org-roam= depends on a custom SQLite
   database running behind the scenes to support its intelligent,
   non-hierarchical note system. However, if you have a standard C compiler
   installed, such as =gcc= or =clang=, =org-roam= will compile the database
   automatically.

   You will need to install the =graphviz= suite of tools in order to use
   =org-roam='s graph functionality.

   Because =org-roam='s nodes are just Org files, you can check your =org-roam=
   database into your favorite version control system. Once pulled down,
   =org-roam= will completely recreate your database from the metadata in your
   repository. [[https://github.com/tjtrabue/roam-notes][I keep my org-roam database on GitHub]].

*** Variables
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

        (setq org-roam-v2-ack t)
        ;; Set the path to the org-roam directory and ensure that directory is
        ;; present before loading org-roam.
        (setq org-roam-directory my/org-roam-dir)
        ;; I have my roam-notes directory checked in as a git repository on GitHub.
        ;; (make-directory org-roam-directory t)
        :config
        ;; Automatically keep org roam session synchronized.
        (org-roam-db-autosync-enable))
    #+end_src

** org-super-agenda
   Improved Org agenda that allows you to break your agenda items up into
   sections.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package org-super-agenda
       :after org)
   #+end_src

** org-download
   Utility for moving downloaded images into Org buffers.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package org-download
       :after org
       :hook
       ;; Enable org-download in dired-mode.
       (dired-mode . org-download-enable)
       :init
       (setq-default org-download-image-dir
                     (file-truename (concat (getenv "HOME") "/images/org")))
       :config
       (make-directory org-download-image-dir t))
   #+end_src

** ox-gfm
   This is a small exporter based on the Markdown exporter already existing in
   Org mode.

     (use-package ox-gfm
       :after org
       :demand t
       :config
       (require 'ox-gfm nil t))
