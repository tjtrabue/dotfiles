#+STARTUP: fold

Provides vertical lines highlighting which character begins an indentation level
similar to the behavior of other modern text editors.

An alternative to this plugin is =highlight-indentaton.el=, which is popular but
much more limited in terms of configuration.

    ;; Only use indent guides when programming.
    (prog-mode . highlight-indent-guides-mode)

    ;; Only highlight the first character of each indent level instead of the
    ;; entire column. This works better with minimap-mode.

    ;; Whether to calculuate the faces for the indent guides automatically based
    ;; on the current theme. I have found that this method does not work well with
    ;; the Modus themes, so be warned. You may need to set the faces manually.

    ;; How to visualize your current position in the guide stack.
    ;; Must be one of:
    ;;   nil (default) - Disable responsive guids.
    ;;   top - Use a different color to highlight the "current" guide
    ;;         (the indentation block of the line that the cursor is on).
    ;;   stack - Like `top', but also use a third color for all "ancestor"
    ;;           guides of the current guide.
    (highlight-indent-guides-responsive 'top)

    ;; Set the faces for the indent guides manually.  This method requires setting
    ;; the `highlight-indent-guides-auto-enabled' variable to nil.
