Provides vertical lines highlighting which character begins an indentation level
similar to the behavior of other modern text editors.

An alternative to this plugin is =highlight-indentaton.el=, which is popular but
much more limited in terms of configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package highlight-indent-guides
    :hook
    ;; Only use indnet guides when programming.
    (prog-mode . (lambda ()
                   (when (not (memq major-mode '(web-mode)))
                     ;; Do not activate highlight-indent-guides-mode for certrain
                     ;; major modes, as the indent guides tend to look ugly in
                     ;; these modes.
                     (highlight-indent-guides-mode 1))))
    :custom
    ;; Only highlight the first character of each indent level instead of the
    ;; entire column. This works better with minimap-mode.
    (highlight-indent-guides-method 'character))
