=tree-sitter= is an incremental parsing system, and is not specific to Emacs.
It provides, among other things, an alternative to =font-lock= for syntax
highlighting.

* tree-sitter
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package tree-sitter
      :demand t
      :hook
      ((after-init . global-tree-sitter-mode)
       ((prog-mode
         conf-mode
         text-mode)
        . (lambda ()
            ;; Activate tree-sitter's improved syntax
            ;; highlighting only if we are using a
            ;; major-mode that has a compatible
            ;; tree-sitter syntax parser
            (if (and (boundp 'tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist)
                     (assq major-mode tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist))
                (tree-sitter-hl-mode))))))
  #+end_src

* tree-sitter-langs
  This is a bundle of pre-defined =tree-sitter= programming languages syntax
  packs.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package tree-sitter-langs
      :demand t)
  #+end_src

* tree-sitter-indent
  Indentation support for some major modes supported by =tree-sitter=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package tree-sitter-indent
      :demand t
      :hook
      ;; Turn on tree-sitter-indent in supported major modes.
      (rust-mode . tree-sitter-indent-mode))
  #+end_src
