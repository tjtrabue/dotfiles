=tree-sitter= is an incremental parsing system, and is not specific to Emacs.
It provides, among other things, an alternative to =font-lock= for syntax
highlighting.

* tree-sitter
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package tree-sitter
      ;; Using built-in treesit package.
      :disabled
      ;; The `treesit' package is built-in to Emacs 29, and we should prefer
      ;; that one.
      :if (or (not (fboundp 'treesit-available-p))
              (not (treesit-available-p)))
      :delight
      :demand t
      :config
      (require 'tree-sitter)
      (global-tree-sitter-mode 1))
  #+end_src

* tree-sitter-langs
  This is a bundle of predefined =tree-sitter= programming languages syntax
  packs.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package tree-sitter-langs
      ;; Using built-in treesit package.
      :disabled
      ;; The `treesit' package is built-in to Emacs 29, and we should prefer
      ;; that one.
      :if (or (not (fboundp 'treesit-available-p))
              (not (treesit-available-p)))
      :after tree-sitter
      :demand t
      :hook
      ;; Enable tree-sitter highlighting whenever possible.
      (tree-sitter-after-on . tree-sitter-hl-mode)
      :config
      (require 'tree-sitter-langs))
  #+end_src

* tree-sitter-indent
  Indentation support for some major modes supported by =tree-sitter=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package tree-sitter-indent
      ;; Using built-in treesit package.
      :disabled
      ;; The `treesit' package is built-in to Emacs 29, and we should prefer
      ;; that one.
      :if (or (not (fboundp 'treesit-available-p))
              (not (treesit-available-p)))
      :after tree-sitter
      :demand t
      :hook
      ;; Turn on tree-sitter-indent in supported major modes.
      (rust-mode . tree-sitter-indent-mode))
  #+end_src
