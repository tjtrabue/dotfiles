Sublime Text-inspired features for Emacs, such as smooth scrolling,
distraction-free editing, and a minimap feature. In my experience, none of these
features work very well. Not only that, but Sublimity puts a /lot/ of strain on
Emacs. Bear this in mind if you decide to use Sublimity.

* =use-package= specification
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package sublimity
      ;; Sublimity isn't very useful, and it makes Emacs very slow.
      :disabled
      :demand t
      :init
      ;; Need this to be 0 for sublimity-scroll to work.
      (setq scroll-margin 0)
      :custom
      ;; Larger values mean scroll step sizes are smaller
      (sublimity-scroll-weight 5)
      ;; Last n scroll steps are of size 1
      (sublimity-scroll-drift-length 10)
      :config
      (require 'sublimity)
      (require 'sublimity-scroll)
      ;; (require 'sublimity-attractive)
      ;; The mini-map is experimental and very slow
      ;; (require 'sublimity-map)
      ;; Make the mini-map update constantly
      ;; (sublimity-map-set-delay 5)
      (sublimity-mode 1)
      (setq auto-hscroll-mode nil)
      (setq sublimity-auto-hscroll-mode t))
