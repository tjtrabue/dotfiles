Scheme is one of the oldest dialects of Lisp still in use, and, along with
Common Lisp, is one of the oldest programming languages still around today.

* Geiser
  Geiser turns Emacs into a powerful Scheme IDE. Thus, Geiser is quite similar
  to SLIME/SLY for Common Lisp, or CIDER for Clojure.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package geiser-mit
      :hook
      (scheme-mode . geiser-mode))
  #+end_src
