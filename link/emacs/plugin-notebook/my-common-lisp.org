#+STARTUP: fold

Contains configuration for the SLIME (Superior Lisp Interaction
Mode for Emacs) package used to integrate Emacs with Common Lisp.
SLIME essentially turns Emacs into a Common Lisp IDE.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

* SLIME
  The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs (SLIME) turns Emacs into a Common
  Lisp IDE.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (use-package slime
      :disabled
      :commands slime
      :hook
      ((lisp-mode . slime-mode)
       (inferior-lisp-mode . inferior-slime-mode))
      :custom
      ;; Bring in almost every contributor package
      ;; (that's what slime-fancy does).
      (slime-contribs '(slime-fancy)))
  #+end_src

* SLY
  SLY is a fork of SLIME with some enhancements. I recommend using SLY over
  SLIME since SLY has fixed many long-standing bugs in SLIME's code.

  Both SLIME and SLY are actively maintained, so which one you decide to use is
  a matter of preference. However, SLY's development team is far more dedicated
  to timely bug fixes and support tickets than SLIME's team.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (use-package sly
      :commands sly
      :hook
      ;; Remember, sly-mode is a minor mode that works alongside lisp-mode.
      (lisp-mode . sly-mode)
      :custom
      ;; Allow better completions.
      (sly-complete-symbol-function 'sly-flex-completions))
  #+end_src
