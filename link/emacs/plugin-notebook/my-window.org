Plugins and configuration for Emacs windows.

* Zoom
=zoom-mode= enforces a balanced window layout when creating new windows and
navigating between them. Inactive windows shrink to predefined dimensions,
allowing the active window to take up the majority of available screen space,
making =zoom-mode= similar to a dynamic tiling window manager for Emacs
windows.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package zoom
    ;; Messes with which-key window
    :disabled
    :demand t
    :config
    (zoom-mode 1))
#+end_src
