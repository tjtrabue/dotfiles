=aggressive-indent-mode= is an improved alternative to =electric-indent-mode=
that keeps your indentation consistent as you manipulate code blocks. Be warned:
It is aggressive, and as such will not allow you to violate it's consistency
guidelines as long as the mode is active. This can get annoying if you value
flexibility in code style over consistency.

      ;; Probably don't want to enable aggressive-indent mode globally.  It's
      ;; helpful, but it doesn't always play nicely with automatic code
      ;; formatters. It's also far more useful in Lisp modes than it is for editing
      ;; ALGOL-derived languages.
