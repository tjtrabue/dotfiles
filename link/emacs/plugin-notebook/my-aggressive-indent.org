=aggressive-indent-mode= is an enhancement on =electric-indent-mode= that keeps
your indentation consistent as you manipulate code blocks. Be warned: It is
aggressive, and as such will not allow you to violate it's consistency
guidelines as long as the mode is active. This can get annoying if you value
flexibility in code style over consistency.

      :disabled
      :hook
      ;; Probably don't want to enable aggressive-indent mode globally.  It's
      ;; helpful, but it doesn't play nicely with automatic code formatters. It's
      ;; also far more useful in Lisp modes than it is for editing ALGOL-derived
      ;; languages.
