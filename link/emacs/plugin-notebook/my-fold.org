=origami= is a smart code-folding plugin for Emacs.

As a rule, Emacs supports lots of different code-folding minor modes, some
of which are built-in, some are external plugins. =origami= is of the latter
category, and it is one of the best representatives.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

* origami
  Code folding backend for Emacs. Works best with ALGOL-derived programming
  languages (C, C++, Java, etc.).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package origami
    :hook
    ((prog-mode conf-mode conf-space-mode) . origami-mode))
#+end_src

* vimish-fold
  =vimish-fold= adds Vim's native code-folding style to Emacs. My personal
  favorite code-folding system.

  The default keybinding for toggling a vimish fold is =C-`=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package vimish-fold
    :after (evil-collection)
    :hook
    ((prog-mode conf-mode conf-space-mode) . vimish-fold-mode)
    ;; These bindings get in the way of standard folding via origami.
    ;; :bind (:map evil-normal-state-map
    ;;  ([remap evil-open-fold] . vimish-fold-unfold)
    ;;  ([remap evil-close-fold] . vimish-fold-refold)
    ;;  ([remap evil-toggle-fold] . vimish-fold-toggle)
    ;;  ([remap evil-open-folds] . vimish-fold-unfold-all)
    ;;  ([remap evil-close-folds] . vimish-fold-refold-all))
  )
#+end_src
