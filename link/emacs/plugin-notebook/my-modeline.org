The Mode Line is one of Emacs' key features: a thin ribbon at the bottom of the
window that displays status information. This file is where we configure the
Mode Line until our hearts are content.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Make the active mode line have a pseudo 3D effect (this assumes
  ;; you are using the default mode line and not an extra package).
  (custom-set-faces
   '(mode-line ((t :box (:style released-button)))))
#+end_src
