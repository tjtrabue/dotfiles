=snails= acts like =rofi= (Linux) or =searchlight= (Mac) for Emacs. It is a
fuzzy searching framework for nearly anything, from web browser history, to open
buffers, to files on disk.

*NOTE:* =snails= is /not/ ready for prime time. The author has not seen fit to
create a MELPA package for it, and due to its odd composition, =straight.el=
cannot build it correctly. The only way I've found to install it properly is to
download the repository manually (or through =straight.el=) and point
=load-path= at the repository's location.
