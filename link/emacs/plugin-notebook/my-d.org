The D programming language is a bit of an odd bird. It's most similar to C++,
and aims to fulfill similar programming needs, but does so using opinionated
programming paradigms such as Behavior-Driven Development and Design by
Contract.

* d-mode
  Major mode for editing files written in the D programming language.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package d-mode
      :mode ("\\.d\\'" . d-mode))
  #+end_src
