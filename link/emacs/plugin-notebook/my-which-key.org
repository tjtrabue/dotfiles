=which-key= is a plugin that displays key completions after you type an
incomplete key command (a prefix) in a popup.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :hook
    (after-init . which-key-mode)
    :custom
    ;; The delay between pressing a key and which-key suggesting further keys
    (which-key-idle-delay 1.0)
    ;; Once which-key is active, shorten the delay for further suggestions
    (which-key-idle-secondary-delay 0.05))
#+end_src
