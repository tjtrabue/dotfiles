=which-key-mode= is a global minor mode that, when active, displays key
completions after you type an incomplete key command (i.e., a prefix) in a
popup. In an editor as keyboard-driven as Emacs I simply can't live without it!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :demand t
    :custom
    ;; The delay between pressing a key and which-key suggesting further keys
    (which-key-idle-delay 1.0)
    ;; Once which-key is active, shorten the delay for further suggestions
    (which-key-idle-secondary-delay 0.05)
    :config
    ;; Enables which-key globally
    (which-key-mode 1))
#+end_src
