A *face* is Emacs terminology for a printable character, entailing copious
levels of metadata for the character, such as font family, font weight,
foreground color, background color, border boxes, and much more.

* engrave-faces
=engrave-faces= is a budding standardized system for exporting fontified code
buffers to any number of backends, such as HTML, LaTeX, ANSI, and potentially
more in the future.
