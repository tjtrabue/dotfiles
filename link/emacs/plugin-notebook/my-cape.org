#+STARTUP: fold

=cape= is a set of enhanced completion-at-point functions (AKA, "capf backends")
that work alongside =company=, =corfu=, or the default completion UI. You can
register =cape-*= functions in the =completion-at-point-functions= list, making
those backends available for completion, either through a completion UI such as
=corfu=, or by pressing =TAB= or =M-TAB=. Users can also bind specific =cape-*=
completion functions directly to keys to invoke them manually.
