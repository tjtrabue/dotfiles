Plugins and configuration for Emacs' built-in directory editor and file
explorer known as =dired=.

To use =image-dired= mode properly, you must install =exiftool= on your system.
This is a Perl based tool, and its installation varies from system to system.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

* dired+
  Use the improved =dired+= plugin for a better =dired= experience.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package dired+
    :after (dired))
#+end_src

* peep-dired
  Preview files in =dired=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package peep-dired
    :after (dired dired+)
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
           ("P" . peep-dired)))
#+end_src
