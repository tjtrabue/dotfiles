#+STARTUP: fold

Plugins and configuration for Emacs' built-in directory editor and file
explorer known as =dired=.

To use =image-dired= mode properly, you must install =exiftool= on your system.
This is a Perl based tool, and its installation varies from system to system.

Needed for performance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

#+end_src

* dired+
  Use the improved =dired+= plugin for a better =dired= experience.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package dired+
    :after dired
    :hook
    (dired-mode . (lambda ()
      ;; Reuse a single dired buffer for each directory visited.
      (diredp-toggle-find-file-reuse-dir 1))))
#+end_src

* peep-dired
  Preview files in =dired=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package peep-dired
    :after (dired)
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
           ("P" . peep-dired)))
#+end_src
* dired-k
  Highlight =dired= buffers with Git information. Inspired by the =k= package
  for Zsh.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (use-package dired-k
      :after dired
      :hook
      ;; Always activate dired-k when dired buffer opens.
      ((dired-initial-position . dired-k)
       (dired-after-readin . dired-k-no-revert)))
  #+end_src
