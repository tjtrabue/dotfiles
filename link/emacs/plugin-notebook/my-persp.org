=persp-mode= is a window configuration management plugin that allows you to save
and restore window layouts from one Emacs session to another.

As long as you are using Emacs >= 24.4 =persp-mode= has no dependencies. If you
are on an older version of Emacs then you also need the =workgroups.el= package.

https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el

Note that all =persp-mode= keybinding keys must proceed after the
=persp-keymap-prefix= has been pressed. This prefix defaults to =C-c p=, but of
course can be configured to whatever you like. I rebound the keymap prefix
because I use =C-c p= as my =projectile= keymap prefix.

Needed for performance:

* persp-mode
  The main package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package persp-mode
    :hook
    (after-init . (lambda ()
      (persp-mode 1)))
    :custom
    ;; switch off animation
    (wg-mortph-on nil)
    (persp-autokill-buffer-on-remove 'kill-weak)
    ;; Change persp-keymap-prefix so as not to conflict with projectile.
    ;; Needs to be set here in :init rather than in :config so that the
    ;; change actually takes place.
    (persp-keymap-prefix (kbd "C-c u"))
    ;; This variable sets the number of seconds until persp-mode
    ;; automatically resumes the last perspective from the autosave
    ;; file. If its value is <= 0, do not resume last perspective.
    (persp-auto-resume-time 1.0))

** Projectile Bridge
   This is a package to integrate =persp-mode= with =projectile=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package persp-mode-projectile-bridge
    :after (persp-mode projectile)
    :hook
    ((persp-mode-projectile-bridge-mode . (lambda ()
       (if persp-mode-projectile-bridge-mode
           (persp-mode-projectile-bridge-find-perspectives-for-all-buffers)
         (persp-mode-projectile-bridge-kill-perspectives))))
     (after-init . persp-mode-projectile-bridge-mode)))
