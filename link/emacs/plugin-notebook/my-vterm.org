=vterm= is a full on terminal emulator for Emacs. It is not at all like
=eshell=, which is a custom shell written in Emacs Lisp completely different
than Bash, Zsh, etc. In contrast, =vterm= is a terminal emulator much like
=xterm=, or =termite=, which in turn can run any shell installed on your
operating system like Bash or Zsh.

Not currently using =vterm= because EShell is largely a better alternative, and
a terminal emulator is a better alternative when EShell is not enough.
