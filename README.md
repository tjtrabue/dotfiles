# dotfiles
What started out as my own personal repo for my zsh dotfiles (used in conjunction with oh-my-zsh) is continually growing into an entire automation project of its own. It now has scripts/aliases for bash as well as zsh, and I plan on adding Microsoft PowerShell support in the future as well. I borrowed heavily from mathiasbynens/dotfiles when structuring this project, and used many of his scripts (which I edited to suit my needs).

# Installation
Simply run one of the initialize executables from the project's root directory, and the installer will prompt you for any further information needed. <br/><br/>
**Currently supported OS's**
  * OS X (tested on Yosemite and up)
      * run `initialize_osx` from the project's root directory to install the dotfiles
