# dotfiles
What started out as my own personal repo for my zsh dotfiles (used in conjunction with oh-my-zsh) is continually growing into an entire automation project of its own. It now has scripts/aliases for bash as well as zsh, and I plan on adding Microsoft PowerShell support in the future as well.
