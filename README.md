# dotfiles
What started out as my own personal repo for my zsh dotfiles (used in conjunction with oh-my-zsh) is continually growing into an entire automation project of its own. It now has scripts/aliases for bash as well as zsh, and I plan on adding Microsoft PowerShell support in the future as well. I borrowed heavily from mathiasbynens/dotfiles when structuring this project, and used many of his scripts (which I edited to suit my needs).

# IMPORTANT NOTE
This project is NOT ready for prime time yet, and I do not recommend you run the install script. This whole thing is still under active development and I have not created a release branch yet. In the future, `master` will contain only stable commits tagged for release, and `develop` will be the branch for active development.
